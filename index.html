<h2>
    Who is Adam Sandler?
</h2>


<p1>
    Born on September 9, 1966, in New York City, Adam Sandler was always the class clown but didn't consider becoming a comedian until his brother
encouraged him to perform at a Boston Comedy Club. He was a regular on MTV's Remote Control and on NBC's Saturday Night Live before devoting himself
to making movies like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Sandler is best known for comedy but has also received critical praise for his dramatic work.

<h3>
    'Billy Madison,' 'Happy Gilmore,' 'The Wedding Singer'
</h3>


<p2>
    Through juvenile antics and sometimes offensive stunts, Sandler kept loyal fans laughing throughout the '90s. His first title film role came in 1995
with Billy Madison. Numerous films followed, including Happy Gilmore in 1996, The Wedding Singer (co-starring Drew Barrymore) and The Water Boy in 1998,
Big Daddy in 1999, and Little Nicky in 2000.

<h3>
    'Punch-Drunk Love,' '50 First Dates' 
</h3>

<p3>
    In 2002 Sandler co-starred with Winona Ryder in Mr. Deeds and the critically acclaimed Punch-Drunk Love opposite Emily Watson. The following year he
starred opposite Jack Nicholson in the hit comedy Anger Management. Sandler re-teamed with Barrymore for another romantic comedy, 50 First Dates (2004),
which fared well at the box office. Taking a more dramatic turn, he starred in the dramedy Spanglish (2004) as a husband experiencing trouble with his
wife (played by Tea Leoni) and developing a relationship with his housekeeper (played by Paz Vega).

<h3>
    'The Longest Yard,' 'Reign Over Me'
</h3>


<p4>
    Sandler continued to vary his work from broad comedies to more weighty material. Remaking the 1974 sports comedy The Longest Yard (2005), he played
a convict who organizes a football game between the inmates and the guards â€” a role originated by Burt Reynolds. Reynolds also appeared in the remake
along with comedian Chris Rock and singer Nelly. The next year, Sandler played an architect who discovers a remote control that gives the power to
fast-forward or rewind his own life in Click (2006). He then took on the role of a man who loses his family in the September 11 terrorist attacks in
Reign Over Me (2007). Through an accidental meeting with an old friend (played by Don Cheadle), Sandler's character begins to rebuild his shattered life.
Sandler earned some positive reviews for his performance, with Variety calling him "compelling" and "excellent."

<h3>
    'I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry'
</h3>


<p5>
    Returning to the over-the-top comedy he is most famous for, Sandler produced and starred in I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry (2007). He played
a straight firefighter who pretends to be in a gay relationship with a widowed firefighter (played by Kevin James) so that his friend can receive
domestic partner benefits for himself and his children.
